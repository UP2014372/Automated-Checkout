# Automated-Checkout
Main repository for this project, built hopefully using Tensorflow and Keras.
Good luck to me lmao let's go

## Execution
To run (pretty obvious but still):
```bash
./start.sh
```

Project consists of **web.py**, a script that runs the web server itself. Here we find the code instantiating the camera declared in camera.py and the Neural Network declared in, you guessed it, **neuralnetwork.py**. 

## Technologies
OpenCV for the webcam interfacing

Tensorflow for the backend machine learning 

Keras for the high level API because I'm lazy lmao
