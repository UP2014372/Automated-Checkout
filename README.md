# Automated-Checkout
Main repository for this project, built hopefully using Tensorflow and Keras.
Good luck to me lmao let's go


OpenCV for the webcam interfacing
Tensorflow for the backend machine learning 
Keras for the high level API because I'm lazy lmao

To run (pretty obvious but still):
```bash
./start.sh
```

Project consists of **web.py**, a script that runs the web server itself. Here we find the code instantiating the camera declared in camera.py and the Neural Network declared in, you guessed it, **neuralnetwork.py**.
